title: Mobile Robot Controlled by a Tactile Wearable for Remote Monitoring
summary: When it comes to monitoring remote environments, which might be hazardous for human presence robotic solutions are a unique way to solve this problem. To solve this issue, we proposed to teleoperate a mobile robot with a tactile glove. A user, who is located far from the robot, sees the environment from the robot's camera on his/her laptop.
